# My CUDA Work
A repository to store my cuda codes, including some common-used kernels. 

## Deps
You are supposed to get a GPU workspace first, below is one of the succeeded examples, 
- `Ubuntu` 16.04
- `Opencv` ≥ 3.1
- `CUDA` 10.0
- `CuDNN` v7.6.5
- `Eigen` ≥ 3.3


## Execution
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haoyuanz13/My-CUDA-Work.git
cd My-CUDA-Work
```



Some of the cuda kernel implementation topics are listed below, alse keep learning and uploading, <br>
- [x] The gray image normalization
- [ ] The rgb image normalization, including channels flip, e.g. bgr to rgb
- [ ] The center-aligned based image padding 
- [ ] The biliner interpolation based image resize
- [ ] The feature map postprocess for the detection scenario
- [ ] The feature map postprocess for the classification scenario, using reducing algorithm
- [ ] The 3D pointclouds generation based on the depth image and camera models
